I have been designing, developing and migrating projects based on JAVA/J2EE and Hadoop (Clouderra and Hortonworks) technologies for more than 9.2 years. Working on various domains like Education, Manufacturing, Health-Care and Hi-Tech, i got opportunities to develop my communication and problem solving skills and have worked on different roles of team member and leader. I have been dealing with migration projects those required a good knowledge of algorithms in order to understand the existing system. I am looking for further challenging opportunities to sharpen my skill set.
